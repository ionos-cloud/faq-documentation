# Trial Conditions

### Q: Why should I create a test account?

With IONOS Cloud every customer can test our production environment. Cloud infrastructure can be thoroughly tested in real-life conditions. If you decide to continue using our services after the end of the test, the infrastructure you set up will remain and only the account status will change. User data saved during registration will be used for billing purposes.

### Q: What happens after I create a test account?

After you enter your company and credit card details, you will have access to a test account within a few minutes. In rare cases, if, for example, a credit card or phone number verification was not completed successfully, another phone call is needed. Our IONOS Cloud sales team will contact you by phone within 24 hours on working days to discuss the next steps.

### Q: What resources are available for me during the trial period and can I customize them?

For the duration of the test period, 8 cores, 20 GB RAM, 600 GB SSD, and HDD, as well as 1 static IP address are available by the standard. Your test is limited to 30 days or maximum resource consumption of 500 euros. If you need more test resources, please talk to your Account Manager.

### Q: Can I see my current resource rate during the trial period?

You can display the resources you are currently using in the Data Center Designer (DCD). This overview includes CPU, RAM, Storage, and IP addresses. Traffic, Windows licenses, backup, or S3 object storage are not currently displayed but can be viewed in detail using our billing API.

### Q: What happens if I run out of testing resources?

As soon as your test credit is spent, your account will be converted to a productive account. Saved payment details will be used for billing purposes.

### Q: What happens after the end of the test phase?

After the test phase expires or resources end, your test account will be converted to a production account. Saved payment details will be used for billing purposes.

### Q: What happens when the trial period ends?

If you decide to continue using our services after the end of the test, the infrastructure you set up will remain in place, only the status of the account will change. User data saved during registration will be used for billing purposes. Henceforward, you will receive a detailed invoice for resources used and costs incurred. If you choose not to continue using it, please delete your allocated resources before the end of the test and notify your account manager. If the manager should arrange the deletion of your resources, please note that the deleted data cannot be recovered.

### Q: I didn't have time to test, can I renew my test account again?

Basically, you have a test period of 30 days. If you need to extend your test period, please get in touch with your IONOS Cloud Account Manager to find a solution.

### Q: Can I also test a private cloud for free for 30 days?

Basically yes. Please contact our sales department directly. This VMware-based solution on dedicated hardware will be built and delivered to you personally. Your account manager will first discuss your requirements and specifications, and then your infrastructure will be available for you in a few days.

### Q: What happens to my data if I don't choose IONOS Cloud?

If you choose not to continue using IONOS Cloud, please delete your allocated resources before the end of the test and notify your account manager. If the manager needs to arrange the removal of your resources, we provide a multi-step removal process. Please note that deleted data cannot be recovered.

Personal data that was collected when creating an account will be deleted by IONOS after the legal and operational retention periods have expired.
