### How can I recover my password?

You can use the [<mark style="color:blue;">Password Recovery</mark>](https://dcd.ionos.com/password-recovery/) option to recover your password. Alternatively, you can select the **forgot password?** option on the [<mark style="color:blue;">DCD Log in</mark>](https://dcd.ionos.com/latest/) web page. 

### How can I update my email address?

Contract owners can contact their account manager or the support team to update the email address registered for their IONOS Cloud accounts. We will verify the request and update the email address accordingly. All other users can update their email address for logging in by contacting the contract owner or administrator.

### Do I need a verification code to log in to IONOS Cloud account?

No verification code is required to log in to your IONOS Cloud account for the first time. Once the **2-Step Verification** is **activated**, you cannot log in again without the code. If the **Authenticator** application is deleted or the device it's on is not available, you will need to contact the support team and request to turn off the **2-Step Verification**. You can then log in again and reactivate the **2-Step Verification** yourself.

### How do I delete my account?

To delete your account, contact your account manager or call us at +49 30 57700 840 or write us an email at [<mark style="color:blue;">beratung@cloud.ionos.de</mark>](mailto:beratung@cloud.ionos.de). To immediately stop your billing, delete the allocated resources and data, and let us know when you want the contract to end. The data cannot be recovered if your resources have been deleted.
