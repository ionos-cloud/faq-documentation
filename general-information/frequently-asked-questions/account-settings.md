### Q: How do I recover my password?

Please use the [password recovery tool](https://dcd.ionos.com/password-recovery/)

You can also click on **forgot password?** on the DCD login page.

### Q: How do I update my email address?

Contract owners can contact their Account Manager or our support team to update the email address registered for their IONOS Cloud account. We will verify the request and update the email address accordingly. All other users can update the email address they use for logging in by contacting the contract owner or administrator.

### Q: Do I need a verification code?

No verification code is required to log in to your IONOS Cloud account for the very first time. Once the 2-Step Verification is activated, you will not be able to log in again without the code. If the Authenticator app is deleted or the device it's on is not available, you will need to contact our support team and request that 2-Step Verification be turned off. You will then be able to log in again and reactivate the 2-Step Verification yourself.

### Q: How do I delete my account?

To delete your account, please get in touch with your Account Manager or call us on +49 30 57700 840 or write to produkt@cloud.ionos.de. For immediate cost stop, simply delete the allocated resources and data, and let us know when you want the contract to end. If your resources have been deleted, please note that this data cannot be recovered.
