### Q: What are cloud servers?

The cloud server is suitable for anyone who wants to have a powerful IT infrastructure at hand at a reasonable price. It's the perfect foundation for a variety of web projects, whether it's a private homepage or company website, a powerful framework for web developers, or a high-performance gaming server. With our cloud servers, you can flexibly balance the necessary resources and pay only for what is actually used. If, for example, you are working on larger projects in which you use servers for different purposes, such as a front-end server with a load balancer in conjunction with database servers that you manage from third-party software via an API, then you can easily match such scenarios with our cloud server solutions. You also get unlimited traffic and high availability.

### Q: Are cloud servers suitable for enterprise hosting?

Yes. Our cloud plans are ideal for small and medium businesses. Just choose the appropriate tariff for your needs based on the required server resources. They are usually differentiated by CPU, RAM, and memory capacity. Fast SSDs (Solid State Disks) with low access times are available in every plan for data transfer and storage. Whenever you need more resources, you can always adjust them as needed in real-time. For larger companies that need even more performance and server resources, we recommend Compute Engine.

### Q: How do I change the data center location?

You can specify the location for a data center only when you provision it for the first time. Once the data center is provisioned, you can no longer change its location.

### Q: I can't access my VM via Remote Console?

DCD Remote Console relies upon VNC (Virtual Network Computing) and requires port 5900. Please always use the latest Java version, and make ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 5900 (VNC) available in your firewall for outgoing connection requests. The Remote Console becomes available immediately once the provisioning of your server is complete.

### Q: Where is my data center located?

*   Go to Dashboard (start page) > My Data Centers.

    \- or -
* Open the VDC
*   Hover over the flag

    The tooltip displays the location of the data center.
