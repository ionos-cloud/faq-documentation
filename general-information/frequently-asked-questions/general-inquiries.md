# General Inquiries

### Q: How do I ensure my data center is properly set up?

Customers should have a basic understanding of cloud hosting platforms before using IONOS Cloud's products and services. The best way to get started is by using our graphic user interface Tutorials. These instructions sets will teach you how to launch a basic data center and set up initial user access and permissions.

Should you require direct assistance, please [contact our Cloud Specialists](https://cloud.ionos.com/help).. They will check your infrastructure to ensure that everything is correctly set up. This service is completely free of charge. Our support service is available 24/7.

**Note:** Cloud Specialists are not able to perform a full migration for new customers. Please let us know if this is necessary, so that we can find the right partner from our IONOS Cloud partner network.

### Q: I need a certain feature but I can't find it on the website. How do I know if you offer it?
