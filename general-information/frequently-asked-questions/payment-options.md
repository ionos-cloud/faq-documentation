# Payment Options

### Which payment methods are available?

You can change your payment method in the DCD at any time. You can choose between SEPA direct debit or credit card (Visa, Mastercard, and Amex).

### Why do I have to register with a credit card?

When registering with a credit card, we can verify that you are indeed a real individual. In addition, we will use your credit card as a payment method after the end of the testing phase. If you want to keep another means of payment, such as SEPA direct debit, you can set it up at any time in the DCD.

### How do I update my payment details?

You can change your payment details in your DCD account at any time. In the **DCD**, go to the **Menu** > **Profile** > **Payment Method**. Only the owner of the contract can administer payment data; other registered users cannot do this.

### Is it possible to pay by invoice or in advance?

To learn about payment possibilities, get in touch with your dedicated account manager.
