# Payment Options

### Q: Which payment methods are available?

You can change your payment method at any time in Data Center Designer. You can choose between SEPA direct debit or credit card (Visa, Mastercard, and Amex).

### Q: Why do I have to register with a credit card?

When registering with a credit card, we can verify that you are indeed a real individual. In addition, we will use your credit card as a payment method after the end of the testing phase. If you want to keep another means of payment, such as SEPA direct debit, you can set it up at any time in the Data Center Designer (DCD).

### Q: How do I update my payment details?

You can change your payment details at any time in your DSD account at \[https://dcd.ionos.com]\(https://dcd.ionos.com/latest/). To do this, log in, go to your profile at the top right and select the "Payment Method". Please note that only the owner of the contract can administer payment data, other registered users cannot do this.

### Q: Is it possible to pay by invoice or in advance?

Please inquire with your dedicated Account Manager.
