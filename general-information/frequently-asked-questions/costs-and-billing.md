### How is the traffic measured and billed?

You pay only for the **outbound traffic**, which passes through our physical gateways. External inbound and internal traffic are free of charge. We meter on **Layer-2 (Ethernet)** frames as they traverse the physical gateways of our data centers. Usage-based charges are rounded to the nearest whole cent by our metering and billing system. For more information, see the [<mark style="color:blue;">IONOS website</mark>](https://cloud.ionos.de/preise).

### What are the charges for traffic over public IPs?

Traffic over public IPs is considered internal traffic and is free of charge.

### What are the costs for a firewall or a load balancer?

Firewalls and load balancers are provided free of charge.

### How much would a data transfer between data centers cost?

Data transfers between data centers in the same geographical regions are free. Traffic exchanged between data centers in different geographical regions is charged. This means transfers between the data center in Karlsruhe and one in Frankfurt are free, while traffic between the same data center in Karlsruhe and one in Las Vegas would be billed.
