## L

#### Live Vertical Scaling

LVS technology permits you to scale the number of CPU cores and amount of RAM while the server is running, without having to restart it. Please note that Windows only allows scaling the number of CPU cores, but not the amount of RAM. For scaling to more than eight CPU cores, Windows requires a reboot. See [Scale resources](https://docs.ionos.com/dcd/getting-started/data-centers#scale-resources)

#### Load Balancer&#x20;

Load balancing refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle. See [Load balancer](https://docs.ionos.com/faq/load-balancer)

#### LVS

If the capacity of your Virtual Data Center no longer matches your requirements, you can still increase or decrease your resources after provisioning. With IONOS Live Vertical Scaling (LVS) you can change the resources of a virtual server during operation without restarting it.

## N

#### NAT Gateway

A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.

#### Network Address Translation (NAT)

Network address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. The technique was originally used to avoid the need to assign a new address to every host when a network was moved, or when the upstream Internet service provider was replaced, but could not route the networks address space. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.

#### Network Load Balancer

Network Load Balancer (NLB) is a pre-configured  VDC element that provides connection-based layer 4 load balancing features and functionality.

NVMe takes advantage of the parallel I/O of the PCIe bus and the low latency of SSDs. It supports speeds up to six times faster than SATA-based SSDs and 10 times faster than hard drives and is especially noticeable when reading and writing large files.&#x20;

## O

#### Object Storage

Object storage (also known as object-based storage is a computer data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems which manages data as a file hierarchy, and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks.&#x20;

Each object typically includes the data itself, a variable amount of metadata, and a globally unique identifier. Object storage can be implemented at multiple levels, including the device level (object-storage device), the system level, and the interface level. In each case, object storage seeks to enable capabilities not addressed by other storage architectures, like interfaces that are directly programmable by the application, a namespace that can span multiple instances of physical hardware, and data-management functions like data replication and data distribution at object-level granularity.

#### Object Storage Key Manager

An application used to store and manage encrption keys for Object Storage.

#### Optimisation

Database optimization is the strategy of reducing database system response time**.** Databases provide us with information stored with a hierarchical and related structure, which allows us to extract the content and arrange it easily. There are plenty of options to choose from for business and companies.

## P

#### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

PITR refers to PostgreSQL’s ability to start from the restore of a full backup, then progressively fetch and apply archived WAL files up to a specified timestamp.

PITR is important when someone has accidentally deleted a table or records in a database or if something has gone wrong which has corrupted the existing database. The fastest solution to this would be to retrieve the transaction logs and recover the database from the last “known good” point. PITR is done differently for individual databases.

#### Power Button

You can choose to Suspend, Resume, or Reset Cubes instances by clicking the Power button at the top right of the Inspector pane or in the context menu of the Cubes instance.

#### Provisioning

Provisioning is the process of setting up IT infrastructure. It can also refer to the steps required to manage access to data and resources, and make them available to users and systems.&#x20;

Provisioning is not the same thing as configuration, but they are both steps in the deployment process. Once something has been provisioned, the next step is configuration.&#x20;

When the term “provisioning” is used, it can mean many different types of provisioning, such as server provisioning, network provisioning, user provisioning, service provisioning, and more.

#### **Public IPv4 Addresses**

Every virtual network interface card that is connected to the Internet is automatically assigned a public IPv4 address by DHCP. This IPv4 address is dynamic, meaning it can change while the virtual server is operational or in the case of a restart.

Customers can reserve static public IPv4 addresses for a fee. These reserved IPv4 addresses can be assigned to a virtual network interface card, which is connected to the Internet, as primary or additional IP addresses.

#### **Private IPv4 Addresses**

In networks that are not connected to the Internet, each virtual network interface card is automatically assigned a private IPv4 address. This is assigned by the DHCP service. These IPv4 addresses are assigned statically to the MAC addresses of the virtual network interface cards.

The use of the IP address assignment can be enabled or disabled for each network interface card. Any private IPv4 addresses pursuant to RFC 1918 can be used in private networks.

#### Puppet

#### SDK

SDK’s are like a toolbox that contain special libraries that can be used to easily manage your cloud servers by using your preferred development or coding language. They hold tools, libraries, relevant documents, sample code, processes, and or guides for use on that particular platform.

#### Server

A server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client.

A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.

#### Token

A token represents some utility, resource, or asset value that can be bought, sold, or traded on an existing blockchain, like Ethereum. Tokens are often used in decentralized applications.

#### Two Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they will be required to provide another piece of information. This second factor could come from one of the following categories:

* **Something you know:** This could be a personal identification number (PIN), a password, answers to “secret questions” or a specific keystroke pattern
* **Something you have:** Typically, a user would have something in their possession, like a credit card, a smartphone, or a small hardware token
* **Something you are:** This category is a little more advanced, and might include biometric pattern of a fingerprint, an iris scan, or a voice print

With 2FA, a potential compromise of just one of these factors won’t unlock the account. So, even if your password is stolen or your phone is lost, the chances of a someone else having your second-factor information is highly unlikely. Looking at it from another angle, if a consumer uses 2FA correctly, websites and apps can be more confident of the user’s identity, and unlock the account.

## V

#### **VDC**

A virtual data center is a collection of cloud resources for creating an enterprise-grade IT infrastructure. VDC resources include the processors, memory, disk space, and networks from which virtual machines are built.
